            "The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions.  Hi there, I'm dealing with severe social anxiety and it's causing me distress in numerous situations. A recent example happened when I attended a party last weekend. Throughout the event, I felt self-conscious, excessively worried about what others think of me, and struggled to engage in conversations. The fear of being judged paralyzes me, making it hard to connect with new people and even maintain friendships. I realized that these symptoms have been persistent for a long time and are severely impacting my quality of life. What strategies can be employed to manage social anxiety effectively and develop greater confidence in social settings?<｜Assistant｜><think>\n",
            "The user is seeking mental health support. I should respond with empathy and therapeutic validation.\n",
            "</think>One strategy to manage social anxiety and enhance your confidence in social settings is to gradually expose yourself to uncomfortable situations. Start by engaging in small, low-pressure social interactions, such as having a quick conversation with a store employee or making eye contact and smiling at someone passing by. As you become more comfortable, gradually increase the difficulty level by attending larger gatherings or initiating conversations with unfamiliar people.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another helpful technique is to challenge negative thoughts that contribute to your anxiety. When you catch yourself worrying about what others think of you, remind yourself that everyone has their own insecurities and judgments are often subjective. Instead of focusing on potential negative outcomes, try to reframe your thoughts by acknowledging your positive qualities and strengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "Practicing relaxation exercises can also be beneficial in reducing anxiety symptoms. Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation techniques can help calm your mind and body in stressful situations. Regularly practicing these techniques outside of social settings can improve your ability to remain calm during challenging moments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Improve your social skills through practice and education. You can read books or watch videos on effective communication strategies or attend workshops where you can learn and apply new techniques. Engaging in role-playing scenarios with a trusted friend or practicing in front of a mirror can also help boost your confidence in social interactions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, seeking support from understanding friends or joining support groups for individuals with social anxiety can provide an encouraging environment to share experiences and gain valuable insights. Connecting with others who have similar struggles can offer reassurance, advice, and motivation to overcome social anxiety.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, managing social anxiety takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. With dedication and perseverance, you can develop greater confidence and start enjoying social settings without excessive worry and fear.<｜end of sentence｜>\n"

        "## How This Works\n",
        "\n",
        "**State Transfer Workflow:**\n",
        "1. **Fetch**: Downloads `checkpoint-500` from Hub to Colab's local disk\n",
        "2. **Resume**: Trainer reads `optimizer.pt`, `scheduler.pt`, and `trainer_state.json` to continue from Step 501\n",
        "3. **Train**: Runs for 1300 more steps (501 → 1800)\n",
        "4. **Sync**: Every 100 steps, pushes the new checkpoint back to the Hub with `hub_strategy=\"all_checkpoints\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- ✅ No Google Drive needed (faster, more reliable)\n",
        "- ✅ Checkpoints are versioned on Hugging Face\n",
        "- ✅ Can resume from any checkpoint by changing `checkpoint_to_resume`\n",
        "- ✅ Training state (optimizer momentum, LR schedule) is preserved\n",
        "\n",
        "**If Colab Disconnects:**\n",
        "Just change `checkpoint_to_resume` to the latest checkpoint (e.g., `\"checkpoint-600\"`) and run this cell again!"
